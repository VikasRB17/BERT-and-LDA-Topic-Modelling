Analysis of full-text Pubmed articles about Mast Cells.

Built upon the repository [a link] (https://github.com/Abiza1403/Topic-Modelling).
Further steps performed:
1. BERT model created
2. LDA model created
3. Dense keras layer created as an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction required for clustering
4. K-means clustering from sklearn to cluster topics together.
